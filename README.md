# switch-remoteplay

The goal of this project is to support playing your Nintendo Switch remotely or locally via your PC keyboard/mouse/controller.

Example [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBqZRA1OZPU).

# Status
One keyboard layout is supported to map keys on a keyboard to control the control sticks and some of the keys on a Nintendo Switch. I've mainly tested this with Animal Crossing. 

# Requirements
* Nintendo Switch
* Linux machine to host the service and connect via Bluetooth to the Switch (tested with a Raspberry Pi 4B)
* (optional) video capture card to see the video (or just have bad quality in a video chat app) 

# Plans
* Support gaming controllers.
* Support custom keyboard layouts.
* Show the video in the client.
* Support recording and running macros.

# Issues
* Be careful not to press Ctrl+W while playing! (will get address eventually)
