# Server

# Setup
Follow the setup instructions for [joycontrol][joycontrol].

For this code, in this server folder:

Note that `sudo` is used to run the server and so it needs to be used to install the dependencies.
I believe it's needed by joycontrol for using Bluetooth because it restarts the Bluetooth service if there are issues connecting.
```bash
sudo pip3 install -e .
```

# Start
```bash
# Append '-r <Switch MAC address>' to reconnect to an already paired Switch.
SECRET_KEY='something random-ish' PYTHONPATH=".:${PYTHONPATH}" sudo python3 switchremoteplay/server.py
```

# API
The service uses a socket to connect to the client.
Events are emitted as strings to the `'p'` (Press) handler.

Normally I like very clear APIs with verbose objects but I haven't worked directly with sockets much and I think you're supposed to keep requests very short so I've set up requests to be very short.
It will also be easier this way for people to write macros.

Here are the events as strings that the API handles: 
## Buttons
### Press a single button:
These single letter command put the button in the pushed state, wait a few milliseconds, and then puts the button in the not pushed state.
Honestly you don't really need this except maybe for simple macros since if you're mapping real controller input you should be setting buttons in the pressed/unpressed state to support holding down a button.

| Switch Button | String |
|---------------|--------|
| L             | `'l'` |
| R             | `'r'` |
| A             | `'a'` |
| B             | `'b'` |
| X             | `'x'` |
| Y             | `'y'` |

### Set a button in the pressed/unpressed state:
Format: `<button> <up/down>`.
* PRESSED/DOWN: `d`.
* UNPRESSED/UP: `u`

Example: push A down with `'a d'` and then let it back up with `'a u'`.

All buttons are supported:
```
'l', 'zl',
'r', 'zr',
'a', 'b', 'x', 'y',
'minus', 'plus',
'r_stick', 'l_stick',
'home', 'capture',
'down', 'up', 'right', 'left'
```

## Sticks
You can press in the control sticks for the button functions as explained above.

Example: push the left stick in with `'l_stick d'` and stop with `'l_stick u'`.

### Moving the sticks
For convenience with macros: `s <stick> <direction>`
* stick: left: `l` or right: `r`
* direction: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, or `center`

Example: move the right stick to the left with `'s r left'` and then set it back to center with `'s r center'`. 

For moving by a specific amount: `s <stick> <direction> <amount>`
* stick: left: `l` or right: `r`
* direction: horizontal: `h` or vertical: `v`
* amount:
  * For your convenience with writing easy to read macros/code:
    * UP/RIGHT: `max`
    * DOWN/LEFT: `min`
    * back to the calibrated center: `center`
  * For convenience with matching the [JavaScript Gamepad API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API/)
a decimal number between `-1.0` and `1.0`:
    * UP/LEFT: `-1.0` (yes `-1.0` is UP, this is how the Gamepad API works)
    * DOWN/RIGHT: `1.0`
    * back to the calibrated center: `0` 

Examples:
* Push the left stick up all the way: `'s l v max'`, then let go of it and set it back to it's center position with: `'s l v center'`.
* Push the right stick halfway to the right: `'s r h 0.5'`.

Angling the sticks: `s <stick> hv <horizontal amount> <vertical amount>`

Example: Push the right stick halfway up and halfway to the right: `'s r hv 0.5 0.5'`.

# Wait
(not supported yet)
This is mainly for macros. It might only be supported by the client and not the server.

Format: `wait <time in milliseconds>`

Example: Do not send any input for 300ms: `'wait 300'`.

The amount of time must be an integer.

# Sending Multiple Commands

## Simultaneous
To run multiple commands at the same time: join commands with `&`

Example: Press A and B down: `'a d&b d'`

Do **not** use single press command like just `'a'`. 
It might seems like it works but the behavior is not guaranteed.

## Sequence
Run one command after another: join commands with `,`

Example: Press A, then wait, then B, then wait, let them both go: `'a d,wait 200,b d,wait 200,a u&b u'`.

# Testing
```bash
sudo pip3 install -e .[test]
sudo pytest
```
